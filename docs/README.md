## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install bsat
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from bsat import CNFExpression, solve_sat

# Parse a CNF formula
formula = "(x | y) & (~x | z) & (~y | ~z)"
cnf = CNFExpression.parse(formula)

# Solve it
result = solve_sat(cnf)

if result:
    print(f"SAT: {result}")
else:
    print("UNSAT")
```

## What is SAT?

The **Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT)** asks: given a Boolean formula, is there an assignment of truth values to variables that makes the formula true?

For example:
- Formula: `(x âˆ¨ y) âˆ§ (Â¬x âˆ¨ z)`
- Question: Can we find values for x, y, z that make this true?
- Answer: Yes! For instance, x=True, y=True, z=True works.

## Why is SAT Important?

1. **First NP-Complete Problem**: SAT was the first problem proven to be NP-complete (Cook-Levin theorem, 1971)
2. **Practical Applications**: Used in:
   - Hardware verification
   - Software testing
   - Automated reasoning
   - Planning and scheduling
   - Cryptography
   - AI and machine learning
3. **Foundation for Other Problems**: Many problems can be reduced to SAT
