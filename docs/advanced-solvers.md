## CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning)

### Overview

**CDCL** is the algorithm behind modern industrial SAT solvers. It extends DPLL with:
1. **Conflict analysis**: Learn why conflicts occur
2. **Clause learning**: Add clauses to prevent repeating mistakes
3. **Non-chronological backtracking**: Jump back further when conflicts detected
4. **Intelligent restarts**: Periodically restart search with learned clauses

**Status**: 🚧 Planned for v0.3

### How It Works

```
CDCL extends DPLL:

DPLL:
  Pick variable → Assign → Simplify → Recurse
                              ↓
                           Conflict? → Backtrack one level

CDCL:
  Pick variable → Assign → Propagate → Conflict?
                                          ↓
                                      Analyze conflict
                                          ↓
                                      Learn new clause
                                          ↓
                                      Backtrack (non-chronologically)
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Unit Propagation (BCP)
When a clause has only one unassigned literal, that literal must be true:

```
Current: x = True
Clause: (¬x ∨ y) becomes (False ∨ y) = (y)
Therefore: y must be True (forced assignment)
```

#### 2. Conflict Analysis
When conflict occurs, analyze the implication graph to find the reason:

```
Conflict: () (empty clause)
Why? Trace back through forced assignments
Result: Learn clause that prevents this conflict in future
```

#### 3. Clause Learning
Add new clauses during search:

```
Initial formula: (x ∨ y) ∧ (¬x ∨ z) ∧ (¬y ∨ ¬z)
During search, learn: (x ∨ ¬z)
New formula: ... ∧ (x ∨ ¬z)
```

#### 4. VSIDS Heuristic
**Variable State Independent Decaying Sum**: Choose variables involved in recent conflicts

- Variables get scores based on conflict involvement
- Scores decay over time
- Pick highest-scoring unassigned variable

### Expected Performance

- **Small instances**: Similar to DPLL
- **Medium instances**: 10-100x faster than basic DPLL
- **Large instances**: Can solve problems DPLL can't touch
- **Structured problems**: Especially effective (e.g., hardware verification)

## WalkSAT

### Overview

**WalkSAT** is a randomized local search algorithm:
1. Start with random assignment
2. While unsatisfied clauses exist:
   - Pick unsatisfied clause
   - Flip one variable in that clause
3. Repeat until solved or timeout

**Status**: 🚧 Planned for v0.4

### How It Works

```
1. Random initial assignment: {x=T, y=F, z=T}
2. Evaluate: Some clauses unsatisfied
3. Pick random unsatisfied clause: (¬x ∨ y ∨ ¬z)
4. Choose variable to flip:
   - With probability p: random variable from clause
   - With probability 1-p: variable that minimizes "breaks" (newly unsatisfied clauses)
5. Flip variable and repeat
```

### Characteristics

**Incomplete**: May not find solution even if one exists
**Probabilistic**: Different runs may give different results
**Fast**: Often finds solutions much faster than DPLL/CDCL

### When to Use

✅ **Good for**:
- Satisfiable instances (want any solution quickly)
- Very large formulas
- Optimization problems (MaxSAT)
- Real-time applications

❌ **Not good for**:
- Proving unsatisfiability
- Needing guaranteed solution
- Small instances (DPLL is fine)

### Variants

- **SKC (Selman-Kautz-Cohen)**: Original WalkSAT
- **Novelty**: Avoid flipping recently flipped variables
- **ProbSAT**: Probability distribution over variables

### Expected Performance

- **Random 3SAT (SAT)**: Often finds solution in seconds
- **Hard instances**: May not find solution
- **UNSAT**: Will never terminate (incomplete)

## Horn-SAT ✅

### Overview

**Horn clauses** have at most one positive literal:
```
(¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ z)  ✓ Horn clause (one positive: z)
(¬x ∨ ¬y)      ✓ Horn clause (zero positive)
(x ∨ ¬y ∨ ¬z)  ✓ Horn clause (one positive: x)
(x ∨ y ∨ ¬z)   ✗ Not Horn (two positive)
```

**Status**: ✅ Implemented in v0.2

### Algorithm

Horn-SAT can be solved in **linear time** O(n+m) using unit propagation:

```
1. Set all variables to False initially
2. Repeat:
   - Find unit clause (single unassigned literal that could satisfy)
   - If positive literal (x): set x = True
   - Propagate implications
3. If empty clause: UNSAT
   If all clauses satisfied: SAT
```

### Usage

```python
from bsat import solve_horn_sat, is_horn_formula, CNFExpression

# Create Horn formula
cnf = CNFExpression.parse("x & (~x | y) & (~y | z)")

# Check if it's Horn
if is_horn_formula(cnf):
    result = solve_horn_sat(cnf)
    if result:
        print(f"SAT: {result}")
    else:
        print("UNSAT")
else:
    print("Not a Horn formula")
```

### Why It's Fast

Unit propagation on Horn clauses always makes progress:
- Each iteration either satisfies a clause or forces a variable
- No backtracking needed!
- Linear time complexity O(n+m)

### Applications

✅ **Logic programming**: Prolog, Datalog
✅ **Expert systems**: Rule-based reasoning
✅ **Type inference**: Programming language compilers
✅ **Database queries**: Conjunctive queries

### Example

```python
# Logic program: likes_pizza(john) → likes_italian(john) → happy(john)
cnf = CNFExpression([
    Clause([Literal('likes_pizza_john')]),
    Clause([Literal('likes_pizza_john', True), Literal('likes_italian_john')]),
    Clause([Literal('likes_italian_john', True), Literal('happy_john')])
])

result = solve_horn_sat(cnf)
# {'likes_pizza_john': True, 'likes_italian_john': True, 'happy_john': True}
```

### Performance

- **Time**: O(n+m) - Linear in formula size
- **Space**: O(n) - Variable assignments
- **Practical**: Can handle millions of clauses efficiently

## XOR-SAT

### Overview

**XOR-SAT** deals with XOR (exclusive-or) constraints:
```
x ⊕ y ⊕ z = 1    (odd number of variables must be True)
x ⊕ y = 0        (variables must have same value)
```

Can encode as CNF but more efficient to solve directly.

**Status**: 🚧 Planned for v0.5

### Algorithm

Use **Gaussian elimination** over GF(2) (binary field):

```
System of XOR equations:
  x ⊕ y ⊕ z = 1
  x ⊕ y     = 0
  y ⊕ z     = 1

Convert to matrix (mod 2):
  [1 1 1 | 1]
  [1 1 0 | 0]
  [0 1 1 | 1]

Gaussian elimination:
  [1 0 0 | 0]
  [0 1 0 | 0]
  [0 0 1 | 1]

Solution: x=0, y=0, z=1
```

### Complexity

- **Solvable**: O(n³) using Gaussian elimination
- **Polynomial time**: Tractable for large systems
- **Better than CNF encoding**: More efficient

### Applications

✅ **Cryptography**: Breaking encryption schemes
✅ **Coding theory**: Error correction codes
✅ **Boolean circuits**: Circuit optimization
✅ **Hardware verification**: Equivalence checking

### XOR vs CNF

**XOR clause**: x ⊕ y ⊕ z = 1

**CNF encoding** (expensive!):
```
(x ∨ y ∨ z) ∧ (¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ z) ∧ (¬x ∨ y ∨ ¬z) ∧ (x ∨ ¬y ∨ ¬z)
```

1 XOR clause → 4 CNF clauses with 3 literals each

**Direct XOR solving is much more efficient!**
