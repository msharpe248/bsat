## Introduction

### Historical Context

In 1978, Thomas J. Schaefer published one of the most elegant and important results in computational complexity theory: a complete characterization of when Boolean satisfiability problems can be solved efficiently. His paper, "The Complexity of Satisfiability Problems" (STOC '78), provided a definitive answer to a fundamental question:

> **The Question:** Given a specific type of Boolean constraint, when can we solve satisfiability in polynomial time, and when is it NP-complete?

### Why This Matters

Before Schaefer's work:
- We knew SAT was NP-complete (Cook-Levin theorem, 1971)
- We knew 2SAT was in P (polynomial time)
- We suspected 3SAT was NP-complete
- But we had no unified theory explaining **which** constraint types were tractable

After Schaefer's work:
- ✅ Complete classification: Every Boolean constraint language is either in P or NP-complete
- ✅ Exactly 6 tractable cases (and everything else is NP-complete)
- ✅ Clear algorithmic guidance for solver selection

### The Significance

Schaefer's Dichotomy Theorem is remarkable because:

1. **Complete:** It covers ALL possible Boolean constraint types
2. **Tight:** There are exactly 6 tractable cases—no more, no less
3. **Practical:** It tells us exactly which solver to use
4. **Beautiful:** The classification is elegant and memorable

---

## The Dichotomy Statement

### Informal Statement

**Schaefer's Dichotomy Theorem (1978):**

> Every Boolean satisfiability problem defined by a finite set of constraint types is either:
> 1. **Solvable in polynomial time (in P)**, OR
> 2. **NP-complete**
>
> There are no intermediate cases (assuming P ≠ NP).

### What This Means

Imagine you have a SAT problem where every clause follows certain rules (e.g., "every clause has exactly 2 literals" or "every clause has at most one positive literal"). Schaefer's theorem tells you:

- If your rules match ONE of the 6 special cases → **Easy!** Polynomial-time algorithm exists
- Otherwise → **Hard!** NP-complete, no efficient algorithm exists (unless P = NP)

## The Six Tractable Cases

### Case 1: 0-Valid (All-False Works)

#### Definition

A constraint language is **0-valid** if every constraint is satisfied when all variables are set to False.

#### Characterization

- **CNF Form:** All clauses contain only negative literals (no positive literals)
- **Property:** The all-false assignment `{x₁=False, x₂=False, ...}` satisfies the entire formula

#### Examples

✅ **0-Valid formulas:**
```
(¬x ∨ ¬y)                       # Both can be false
(¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ ¬z)                  # All can be false
(¬a ∨ ¬b) ∧ (¬b ∨ ¬c) ∧ (¬a ∨ ¬c)  # Complete 0-valid CNF
```

❌ **Not 0-valid:**
```
(x ∨ ¬y)        # Has positive literal x
(¬x ∨ y)        # Has positive literal y
(x ∨ y ∨ z)     # All positive
```

#### Why It's Tractable

**Complexity:** O(1) - constant time!

**Algorithm:**
```python
def solve_0_valid(cnf):
    """
    Solve 0-valid SAT in constant time
    """
    # Check that all clauses are 0-valid (only negative literals)
    for clause in cnf.clauses:
        if any(not lit.negated for lit in clause.literals):
            return None  # Not 0-valid

    # Solution: set all variables to False
    variables = cnf.get_variables()
    return {var: False for var in variables}
```

**Intuition:** If setting everything to False works, we're done instantly!

#### BSAT Status

❌ **Not implemented** (trivial case)

**Why not implemented:** This is so simple that it doesn't need a dedicated solver. If you have a 0-valid formula, the solution is immediate.

#### Applications

- **Conflict avoidance:** Modeling "at most zero of these conditions can be true"
- **AtMost-0 constraints:** Ensuring variables don't simultaneously activate
- **Preprocessing:** Detecting trivially satisfiable subformulas

---

### Case 2: 1-Valid (All-True Works)

#### Definition

A constraint language is **1-valid** if every constraint is satisfied when all variables are set to True.

#### Characterization

- **CNF Form:** All clauses contain only positive literals (no negative literals)
- **Property:** The all-true assignment `{x₁=True, x₂=True, ...}` satisfies the entire formula

#### Examples

✅ **1-valid formulas:**
```
(x ∨ y)                    # Both can be true
(x ∨ y ∨ z)                # All can be true
(a ∨ b) ∧ (b ∨ c) ∧ (a ∨ c)  # Complete 1-valid CNF
```

❌ **Not 1-valid:**
```
(¬x ∨ y)        # Has negative literal ¬x
(x ∨ ¬y)        # Has negative literal ¬y
(¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ ¬z)  # All negative
```

#### Why It's Tractable

**Complexity:** O(1) - constant time!

**Algorithm:**
```python
def solve_1_valid(cnf):
    """
    Solve 1-valid SAT in constant time
    """
    # Check that all clauses are 1-valid (only positive literals)
    for clause in cnf.clauses:
        if any(lit.negated for lit in clause.literals):
            return None  # Not 1-valid

    # Solution: set all variables to True
    variables = cnf.get_variables()
    return {var: True for var in variables}
```

**Intuition:** If setting everything to True works, we're done instantly!

#### BSAT Status

❌ **Not implemented** (trivial case)

**Why not implemented:** Like 0-valid, this is trivial and doesn't need a solver.

#### Applications

- **AtLeast-1 constraints:** Ensuring at least one condition is active
- **Coverage problems:** Guaranteeing all options are covered
- **Positive monotone problems:** Optimization where "more is better"

#### Relationship to 0-Valid

These are **duals** of each other:
- Negate all literals in a 0-valid formula → get a 1-valid formula
- Negate all literals in a 1-valid formula → get a 0-valid formula

---

### Case 3: Bijunctive (2SAT)

#### Definition

A constraint language is **bijunctive** if every constraint is a disjunction of at most 2 literals.

#### Characterization

- **CNF Form:** Every clause has ≤ 2 literals
- **Also called:** 2SAT, binary clauses
- **Property:** Width restriction (clause size ≤ 2)

#### Examples

✅ **Bijunctive (2SAT) formulas:**
```
(x ∨ y)                           # Binary clause
(¬x ∨ z)                          # Binary clause
(x)                               # Unit clause (width 1, allowed)
(x ∨ y) ∧ (¬x ∨ z) ∧ (¬y ∨ ¬z)     # Complete 2SAT formula
```

❌ **Not bijunctive:**
```
(x ∨ y ∨ z)                  # Three literals (3SAT)
(¬a ∨ b ∨ c ∨ d)             # Four literals
```

#### Why It's Tractable

**Complexity:** O(n + m) where n = variables, m = clauses

**Key Insight:** 2SAT can be viewed as an implication graph:
- Clause `(¬x ∨ y)` is equivalent to implication `x → y`
- If x is true, then y must be true
- Build directed graph of implications
- Use Strongly Connected Components (SCC) to find solution

**Algorithm Overview:**
1. Build implication graph: For each clause `(a ∨ b)`, add edges `¬a → b` and `¬b → a`
2. Find SCCs using Kosaraju's or Tarjan's algorithm (O(n+m))
3. Check for contradictions: If x and ¬x in same SCC → UNSAT
4. Construct solution from SCC ordering

#### BSAT Implementation

✅ **Implemented:** `src/bsat/twosatsolver.py`

**Usage Example:**
```python
from bsat import CNFExpression, solve_2sat, is_2sat

# Create a 2SAT formula
formula = "(x | y) & (~x | z) & (~y | ~z)"
cnf = CNFExpression.parse(formula)

# Check if it's 2SAT
if is_2sat(cnf):
    print("This is 2SAT - solvable in polynomial time!")

    # Solve it
    result = solve_2sat(cnf)

    if result:
        print(f"SAT: {result}")
        assert cnf.evaluate(result), "Solution must satisfy formula"
    else:
        print("UNSAT")
else:
    print("Not 2SAT - use general SAT solver")
```

**Output:**
```
This is 2SAT - solvable in polynomial time!
SAT: {'x': False, 'y': False, 'z': False}
```

#### Implication Graph Example

For formula `(x ∨ y) ∧ (¬x ∨ z) ∧ (¬y ∨ ¬z)`:

```
Implications:
  (x ∨ y)   → {¬x → y, ¬y → x}
  (¬x ∨ z)  → {x → z, ¬z → ¬x}
  (¬y ∨ ¬z) → {y → ¬z, z → ¬y}

Graph:
    ¬x ──→ y
     ↑      ↓
     |      ¬z ←─┐
     |           |
    ¬z ───→ ¬x  |
                 |
     x ───→ z ──┘
     ↑      ↓
     |      ¬y
     |      ↓
    ¬y ──→ x
```

#### Applications

- **2-SAT solvers:** Digital circuit verification, type inference
- **Implication problems:** If A then B, logical dependencies
- **Horn clause approximation:** Relaxing Horn constraints

#### The P/NP-Complete Boundary

**2SAT is the boundary:**
- 1SAT (unit clauses): Trivial, O(n)
- 2SAT: Polynomial, O(n+m) ✅
- 3SAT: NP-complete ❌
- k-SAT (k ≥ 3): NP-complete ❌

This is one of the most striking examples of complexity phase transitions in computer science!

### Case 4: Horn (≤1 Positive Literal per Clause)

#### Definition

A constraint language is **Horn** if every constraint has at most one positive (unnegated) literal.

#### Characterization

- **CNF Form:** Each clause has ≤ 1 positive literal (any number of negative literals allowed)
- **Also called:** Horn clauses, Horn SAT
- **Interpretation:** Implications and facts in logic programming

#### Examples

✅ **Horn formulas:**
```
(¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ z)       # One positive (z)
(¬x ∨ y)            # One positive (y), means x → y
(¬x ∨ ¬y)           # Zero positive (also Horn!)
(x)                 # One positive unit clause (fact)
(¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ ¬z)      # Zero positive (valid Horn)
```

**As implications:**
```
(¬x ∨ y)            ≡ (x → y)         "If x then y"
(¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ z)       ≡ (x ∧ y → z)     "If x and y then z"
(¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ ¬z)      ≡ (x ∧ y ∧ z → ⊥) "x, y, z cannot all be true"
(x)                 ≡ (True → x)      "x is a fact"
```

❌ **Not Horn formulas:**
```
(x ∨ y)             # Two positive literals
(¬x ∨ y ∨ z)        # Two positive literals
(x ∨ y ∨ z)         # Three positive literals
```

#### Why It's Tractable

**Complexity:** O(n + m)

**Key Insight:** Horn clauses support **forward chaining** (unit propagation):
1. Start with all variables set to False
2. Find unit clauses (single positive literal) → set those to True
3. Propagate implications: If `x ∧ y → z` and both x, y are True → set z to True
4. Repeat until no more propagations
5. Check if any clause is unsatisfied

**Algorithm (Unit Propagation):**
```
1. Initialize: All variables False
2. While there exists a unit clause (positive literal) or implications that fire:
   a. Unit clause (x): Set x = True
   b. Implication (¬x₁ ∨ ... ∨ ¬xₖ ∨ y) where all xᵢ are True: Set y = True
3. If any clause is unsatisfied: UNSAT
4. Otherwise: Current assignment is SAT
```

#### BSAT Implementation

✅ **Implemented:** `src/bsat/hornsat.py`

**Usage Example:**
```python
from bsat import CNFExpression, solve_horn_sat, is_horn_formula

# Horn formula: Rules in a logic program
formula = """
x & (~x | y) & (~y | z)
"""
# Interpretation:
#   x is a fact
#   x → y (if x then y)
#   y → z (if y then z)
# Conclusion: x, y, z must all be True

cnf = CNFExpression.parse(formula)

if is_horn_formula(cnf):
    print("This is Horn-SAT - solvable in O(n+m)!")

    result = solve_horn_sat(cnf)

    if result:
        print(f"Solution: {result}")
        # Output: {'x': True, 'y': True, 'z': True}
    else:
        print("UNSAT")
else:
    print("Not Horn-SAT")
```

#### Visual: Forward Chaining

```
Formula: (x) ∧ (¬x ∨ y) ∧ (¬y ∨ z)

Step 1: x is a unit clause
  Set x = True

Step 2: (¬x ∨ y) with x = True
  Implies y must be True
  Set y = True

Step 3: (¬y ∨ z) with y = True
  Implies z must be True
  Set z = True

Result: {x: True, y: True, z: True}
```

#### Applications

**Logic Programming:**
- **Prolog:** Horn clauses are the foundation of Prolog
- **Expert systems:** Rules like "IF condition THEN conclusion"
- **Type inference:** Hindley-Milner type systems use Horn clauses
- **Datalog:** Database query language based on Horn logic

**Example - Expert System:**
```python
# Rules for medical diagnosis
rules = """
(fever) &                              # Patient has fever (fact)
(~fever | infection) &                 # Fever → infection
(~infection | needs_antibiotic) &     # Infection → needs antibiotic
"""

cnf = CNFExpression.parse(rules)
diagnosis = solve_horn_sat(cnf)

if diagnosis['needs_antibiotic']:
    print("Prescribe antibiotics")
```

#### Why Horn Clauses Are Important

1. **Natural for rules:** Human reasoning often follows "if-then" patterns
2. **Efficient:** O(n+m) is practical for large knowledge bases
3. **Widely used:** Prolog, expert systems, static analysis tools
4. **Compositional:** Easy to add new rules without breaking existing ones

---

### Case 5: Dual-Horn (≤1 Negative Literal per Clause)

#### Definition

A constraint language is **Dual-Horn** (also called **Anti-Horn** or **Reverse Horn**) if every constraint has at most one negative (negated) literal.

#### Characterization

- **CNF Form:** Each clause has ≤ 1 negative literal (any number of positive literals allowed)
- **Relationship:** Complement/dual of Horn clauses
- **Interpretation:** Reverse implications, backward chaining

#### Examples

✅ **Dual-Horn formulas:**
```
(x ∨ y ∨ ¬z)         # One negative (¬z)
(x ∨ ¬y)             # One negative (¬y)
(x ∨ y)              # Zero negative (also dual-Horn!)
(¬x)                 # One negative unit clause
(x ∨ y ∨ z)          # Zero negative (valid dual-Horn)
```

❌ **Not Dual-Horn formulas:**
```
(¬x ∨ ¬y)            # Two negative literals
(¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ z)        # Two negative literals (this is Horn!)
(¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ ¬z)       # Three negative literals
```

#### Why It's Tractable

**Complexity:** O(n + m)

**Key Insight:** Dual-Horn is **algorithmically equivalent to Horn-SAT** through negation:

**Algorithm:**
```
1. Negate all literals in the formula
   - Dual-Horn formula → becomes Horn formula
2. Apply Horn-SAT solver
3. Negate the solution
   - If Horn-SAT returns {x: True, y: False}
   - Return {x: False, y: True}
```

#### Transformation Example

**Original Dual-Horn formula:**
```
(x ∨ y ∨ ¬z) ∧ (x ∨ ¬w) ∧ (y ∨ z)
```

**Step 1:** Negate all literals:
```
(¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ z) ∧ (¬x ∨ w) ∧ (¬y ∨ ¬z)
```
Notice: This is now Horn (at most 1 positive per clause)!

**Step 2:** Solve as Horn-SAT:
```python
result_horn = solve_horn_sat(negated_formula)
# Suppose result: {x: False, y: False, z: True, w: True}
```

**Step 3:** Negate solution:
```python
result_dual_horn = {var: not val for var, val in result_horn.items()}
# Result: {x: True, y: True, z: False, w: False}
```

#### BSAT Status

❌ **Not currently implemented**

**Why it should be implemented:**
- Educational value: Shows duality in constraint types
- Theoretical completeness: Covers all 6 Schaefer cases
- Simple to implement: ~20 lines of code (transform + call Horn solver)

**Proposed implementation:**
```python
def solve_dual_horn_sat(cnf):
    """
    Solve dual-Horn SAT by transforming to Horn-SAT

    Complexity: O(n + m)
    """
    # Check if formula is dual-Horn
    for clause in cnf.clauses:
        neg_count = sum(1 for lit in clause.literals if lit.negated)
        if neg_count > 1:
            return None  # Not dual-Horn

    # Step 1: Negate all literals
    negated_cnf = negate_formula(cnf)

    # Step 2: Solve as Horn-SAT
    horn_solution = solve_horn_sat(negated_cnf)

    if horn_solution is None:
        return None  # UNSAT

    # Step 3: Negate solution back
    return {var: not val for var, val in horn_solution.items()}
```

#### Applications

- **Backward chaining:** Reasoning from goals to facts (opposite of Horn)
- **Goal-directed search:** Planning systems that work backwards
- **Reverse implications:** "To achieve Y, we need X"
- **Minimal models:** Finding minimal satisfying assignments

#### Relationship to Horn

| Property | Horn | Dual-Horn |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Positive literals** | ≤ 1 | Any number |
| **Negative literals** | Any number | ≤ 1 |
| **Direction** | Forward chaining | Backward chaining |
| **Default value** | Start all False | Start all True |
| **Applications** | Prolog, rules | Goal-directed reasoning |

### Case 6: Affine (XOR-SAT / Linear Equations over GF(2))

#### Definition

A constraint language is **affine** if every constraint is a linear equation over the finite field GF(2) (integers modulo 2).

#### Characterization

- **Mathematical:** System of linear equations over GF(2)
- **Boolean:** XOR (exclusive-OR) combinations of variables
- **CNF encoding:** Requires exponential blowup (2^(k-1) clauses for k variables)
- **Also called:** XOR-SAT, parity constraints, affine constraints

#### Examples

**✅ Affine constraints (mathematical form):**
```
x ⊕ y = 1         # x XOR y equals 1 (exactly one is True)
x ⊕ y ⊕ z = 0     # Even parity: even number of variables True
x ⊕ y = 0         # x and y have same value
¬x ⊕ y = 1        # ¬x XOR y (equivalent to x ⊕ y = 0)
```

**CNF encoding (exponential size!):**
```
x ⊕ y = 1   ↔   (x ∨ y) ∧ (¬x ∨ ¬y)           [2 clauses]

x ⊕ y ⊕ z = 1   ↔   (x ∨ y ∨ z) ∧              [4 clauses]
                     (x ∨ ¬y ∨ ¬z) ∧
                     (¬x ∨ y ∨ ¬z) ∧
                     (¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ z)

x ⊕ y ⊕ z ⊕ w = 0   ↔   [8 clauses needed!]
```

**❌ Not affine:**
```
(x ∨ y)          # OR, not XOR
(x ∧ y)          # AND, not XOR
(x → y)          # Implication, not XOR
```

#### Why It's Tractable

**Complexity:** O(n³) using Gaussian elimination

**Key Insight:** XOR-SAT is a system of linear equations over the field Z₂ (modulo 2):

**Linear algebra view:**
```
x ⊕ y ⊕ z = 1
x ⊕ z = 0
y ⊕ z = 1

Matrix form (over GF(2)):
┌         ┐ ┌   ┐   ┌   ┐
│ 1  1  1 │ │ x │   │ 1 │
│ 1  0  1 │ │ y │ = │ 0 │
│ 0  1  1 │ │ z │   │ 1 │
└         ┘ └   ┘   └   ┘
```

**Algorithm (Gaussian Elimination over GF(2)):**
1. Convert XOR constraints to matrix form Ax = b (mod 2)
2. Perform Gaussian elimination (O(n³) operations)
3. Back-substitution to find solution
4. Check for inconsistencies (row [0 0 ... 0 | 1] means UNSAT)

#### BSAT Implementation

✅ **Implemented:** `src/bsat/xorsat.py`

**Usage Example:**
```python
from bsat import solve_xorsat, CNFExpression, Clause, Literal

# Create XOR constraints
# Note: Must manually construct XOR as CNF (no parser support for XOR syntax yet)

# Example: x ⊕ y = 1 (exactly one is true)
# CNF: (x ∨ y) ∧ (¬x ∨ ¬y)
xor_x_y = CNFExpression([
    Clause([Literal('x', False), Literal('y', False)]),   # x ∨ y
    Clause([Literal('x', True), Literal('y', True)])      # ¬x ∨ ¬y
])

result = solve_xorsat(xor_x_y)
print(f"Solution: {result}")
# Possible output: {'x': True, 'y': False} or {'x': False, 'y': True}

# Verify it's a valid XOR
assert result['x'] != result['y'], "XOR means they must differ"
```

**More complex example:**
```python
# System of XOR equations:
#   x ⊕ y ⊕ z = 1
#   x ⊕ z = 0
#   y ⊕ z = 1

# This would require encoding each XOR as CNF (4 + 2 + 2 = 8 clauses)
# Then solve with solve_xorsat()

result = solve_xorsat(xor_cnf)
if result:
    print(f"Solution: {result}")
    # Output might be: {'x': False, 'y': True, 'z': False}
else:
    print("UNSAT - inconsistent XOR system")
```

#### Applications

**Cryptography:**
- **Linear cryptanalysis:** Breaking block ciphers
- **Boolean functions:** Analyzing S-boxes in AES, DES
- **Stream ciphers:** LFSR-based systems produce linear equations

**Coding Theory:**
- **Error correction:** Linear codes (Hamming codes, Reed-Solomon)
- **Parity checks:** Detecting and correcting bit errors
- **LDPC codes:** Low-density parity-check codes

**Computer Algebra:**
- **Gröbner bases:** Boolean ideals
- **Polynomial systems:** Over GF(2)
- **Symbolic computation:** Boolean algebra simplification

#### Example: Cryptanalysis

```python
# Simplified linear cryptanalysis scenario
# We observe relationships between plaintext and ciphertext bits

equations = """
# Plaintext bits: p1, p2, p3
# Key bits: k1, k2, k3
# Ciphertext bits: c1, c2, c3

# Linear approximations discovered:
# p1 ⊕ p2 ⊕ k1 = c1
# p2 ⊕ p3 ⊕ k2 = c2
# p1 ⊕ p3 ⊕ k3 = c3

# Given known plaintext-ciphertext pair:
# p1=1, p2=0, p3=1
# c1=0, c2=1, c3=1

# Solve for key bits k1, k2, k3:
# 1 ⊕ 0 ⊕ k1 = 0  →  k1 = 1
# 0 ⊕ 1 ⊕ k2 = 1  →  k2 = 0
# 1 ⊕ 1 ⊕ k3 = 1  →  k3 = 1
"""

# Recovered key: k1=1, k2=0, k3=1
```

#### Why XOR-SAT is Special

1. **Algebraic structure:** Only constraint type with field structure
2. **Efficient:** O(n³) is practical even for thousands of variables
3. **Unique solutions:** Often has exactly one solution or no solution (unlike SAT which can have exponentially many)
4. **Applications:** Critical in cryptography and coding theory

## Why Everything Else is NP-Complete

### The Negative Result

Schaefer proved that if a Boolean constraint language does **NOT** satisfy any of the 6 tractable properties, then the satisfiability problem is **NP-complete**.

### Key Examples of NP-Complete Cases

#### 1. 3SAT (General 3-Literal Clauses)

```python
# 3SAT formula
(x ∨ y ∨ z) ∧ (¬x ∨ y ∨ ¬z) ∧ (x ∨ ¬y ∨ z)
```

**Why NP-complete:**
- ❌ Not 0-valid: clause `(x ∨ y ∨ z)` fails with all-false
- ❌ Not 1-valid: clause `(¬x ∨ y ∨ ¬z)` can fail with all-true
- ❌ Not bijunctive: clauses have 3 literals (not ≤2)
- ❌ Not Horn: clause `(x ∨ y ∨ z)` has 3 positive literals
- ❌ Not dual-Horn: clause `(¬x ∨ y ∨ ¬z)` has 2 negative literals
- ❌ Not affine: OR clauses, not XOR

**Fails all 6 properties → NP-complete** (Cook-Levin theorem)

#### 2. NAE-3SAT (Not-All-Equal)

```python
# Not-all-equal constraint: In (x,y,z), don't make all three the same
NAE(x, y, z) ∧ NAE(a, b, c)
```

**Why NP-complete:**
- Encodes to: `(x ∨ y ∨ z) ∧ (¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ ¬z)` for each NAE
- Fails all 6 Schaefer properties
- Even though NAE has nice symmetry (self-complementary), still NP-complete

#### 3. 1-in-3-SAT (Exactly One)

```python
# Exactly one of (x,y,z) must be true
1-in-3(x, y, z)
```

**Why NP-complete:**
- Requires combination of OR and AtMost constraints
- Even **positive 1-in-3-SAT** (no negations!) is NP-complete
- Shows that monotonicity alone doesn't guarantee tractability

#### 4. Positive 3SAT (Monotone 3SAT)

```python
# All positive literals (no negations)
(x ∨ y ∨ z) ∧ (x ∨ w ∨ v) ∧ (y ∨ z ∨ w)
```

**Why NP-complete:**
- ✅ Is 1-valid (all-true works)
- ❌ But NOT all clauses are positive 2-literal (not bijunctive)
- The width (3 literals) makes it hard despite monotonicity
- This is surprising: even "positive" formulas are hard!

### The Proof Intuition

Schaefer's proof works by showing:

1. If constraint type violates all 6 properties
2. Then you can **encode 3SAT** using only those constraints
3. Since 3SAT is NP-complete (Cook-Levin), the constraint type is also NP-complete
4. This is a **reduction**: 3SAT ≤_p YourConstraintType

**Example reduction:**
```
3SAT clause: (x ∨ y ∨ z)

If you have NAE constraints:
  NAE(x, y, z, t) where t is auxiliary variable
  (With right auxiliary structure, this encodes OR)

Thus: NAE-3SAT is at least as hard as 3SAT → NP-complete
```

## Practical Guide: Choosing the Right Solver

### Decision Tree

```
Start: I have a CNF formula. Which solver should I use?
│
├─ All clauses only negative literals? (e.g., ¬x ∨ ¬y)
│  └─ YES → 0-valid: Solution = all False (O(1))
│
├─ All clauses only positive literals? (e.g., x ∨ y)
│  └─ YES → 1-valid: Solution = all True (O(1))
│
├─ All clauses have ≤ 2 literals? (e.g., x ∨ y, ¬x ∨ z)
│  └─ YES → 2SAT: Use solve_2sat() (O(n+m))
│
├─ All clauses have ≤ 1 positive literal? (e.g., ¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ z)
│  └─ YES → Horn-SAT: Use solve_horn_sat() (O(n+m))
│
├─ All clauses have ≤ 1 negative literal? (e.g., x ∨ y ∨ ¬z)
│  └─ YES → Dual-Horn: Transform to Horn, solve (O(n+m))
│
├─ All clauses encode XOR constraints? (e.g., x ⊕ y = 1)
│  └─ YES → XOR-SAT: Use solve_xorsat() (O(n³))
│
└─ None of the above?
   └─ General SAT: Use solve_cdcl() or solve_sat() (NP-complete)
      - Small instances (< 15 vars): solve_sat() (DPLL)
      - Large instances (25+ vars): solve_cdcl() (CDCL with learning)
      - Random 3SAT: solve_schoening() (probabilistic, O(1.334^n))
```

### Python Implementation: Automatic Solver Selection

```python
def classify_and_solve(cnf):
    """
    Automatically classify formula and use best solver
    """
    # Check 0-valid (all negative)
    if all(all(lit.negated for lit in clause.literals)
           for clause in cnf.clauses):
        print("0-valid detected → O(1) solution")
        return {var: False for var in cnf.get_variables()}

    # Check 1-valid (all positive)
    if all(all(not lit.negated for lit in clause.literals)
           for clause in cnf.clauses):
        print("1-valid detected → O(1) solution")
        return {var: True for var in cnf.get_variables()}

    # Check 2SAT (width ≤ 2)
    if is_2sat(cnf):
        print("2SAT detected → O(n+m) algorithm")
        return solve_2sat(cnf)

    # Check Horn (≤1 positive per clause)
    if is_horn_formula(cnf):
        print("Horn-SAT detected → O(n+m) algorithm")
        return solve_horn_sat(cnf)

    # Check Dual-Horn (≤1 negative per clause)
    if is_dual_horn_formula(cnf):
        print("Dual-Horn detected → O(n+m) via transformation")
        return solve_dual_horn_sat(cnf)

    # Check XOR-SAT (harder to detect from CNF encoding)
    # (Requires checking if CNF encodes XOR constraints)

    # Default: General SAT
    print("General SAT → Using CDCL solver (NP-complete)")
    return solve_cdcl(cnf)
```

### Usage Example

```python
from bsat import CNFExpression

# Example 1: Horn formula
horn_formula = "x & (~x | y) & (~y | z)"
cnf1 = CNFExpression.parse(horn_formula)
result1 = classify_and_solve(cnf1)
# Output: "Horn-SAT detected → O(n+m) algorithm"
# Result: {'x': True, 'y': True, 'z': True}

# Example 2: 2SAT formula
two_sat_formula = "(x | y) & (~x | z) & (~y | ~z)"
cnf2 = CNFExpression.parse(two_sat_formula)
result2 = classify_and_solve(cnf2)
# Output: "2SAT detected → O(n+m) algorithm"

# Example 3: General 3SAT (NP-complete)
three_sat_formula = "(x | y | z) & (~x | y | ~z)"
cnf3 = CNFExpression.parse(three_sat_formula)
result3 = classify_and_solve(cnf3)
# Output: "General SAT → Using CDCL solver (NP-complete)"
```

## Summary

### The Six Tractable Cases (Memorization Aid)

**"Two Zeros, Two Valids, Two Classes"**

1. **0-Valid:** All negative → set all False
2. **1-Valid:** All positive → set all True
3. **Bijunctive (2SAT):** Width ≤ 2 → SCC algorithm
4. **Horn:** ≤1 positive → forward chaining
5. **Dual-Horn:** ≤1 negative → backward chaining
6. **Affine (XOR):** Linear equations → Gaussian elimination

**Everything else is NP-complete!**

### Key Takeaways

✅ Schaefer's theorem completely classifies Boolean constraint complexity
✅ Exactly 6 polynomial-time cases exist
✅ BSAT implements 3 of 6 (2SAT, Horn, XOR)
✅ Width matters: 2SAT is easy, 3SAT is hard
✅ Polarity matters: Horn is easy, mixed polarity is hard
✅ Structure matters: XOR has algebraic structure, general SAT doesn't
