    Horn-SAT solver using unit propagation.

    A Horn clause has at most one positive literal. Horn-SAT can be solved
    in polynomial time O(n+m) where n is variables and m is clauses.

    The algorithm uses unit propagation exclusively:
    1. Start with all variables False
    2. Find unit clauses (single literal)
    3. If positive literal: set variable True
    4. Repeat until no more unit clauses
    5. Check if all clauses are satisfied

    Space complexity: O(n) - variable assignments
