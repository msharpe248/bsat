# Session Status - CDCL Solver Debugging

## Completed âœ…

### Python CDCL - 100% FIXED
Fixed 3 critical soundness bugs in `src/bsat/cdcl.py`:

1. **Bug #1 (line 256-258):** Trail[-1] access when antecedent_idx is -1
2. **Bug #2 (lines 246, 265):** Incorrect learned clause literal polarity  
3. **Bug #3 (lines 406-435):** Missing propagation after backtracking

**Result:** âœ… 9/9 tests passing (100% correctness)
**Committed & Pushed:** Yes (commit 4d45ab2)

## In Progress ðŸ”§

### C CDCL - 88.9% Correct (8/9 tests passing)

**Status:** Infinite loop FIXED, but soundness bug remains on random3sat_v15_c64.cnf

**Symptoms:**
- C solver claims UNSAT when instance is SAT
- Eventually learns unit clause `Â¬x1` at level 0
- But SAT solution has x1=True

**Root Cause:** Under investigation - likely subtle bug in conflict analysis literal polarity or resolution

**Next Steps:** Deep debugging of resolution algorithm, compare learned clauses with MiniSat
