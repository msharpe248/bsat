# Random Phase Selection in SAT Solvers

**Status**: Implemented ✅
**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Feature**: Week 6 optimization

---

## Overview

**Random phase selection** is a diversification technique in CDCL SAT solvers that occasionally chooses a random polarity (True/False) instead of using the saved phase. This helps the solver escape local minima where phase saving might get stuck trying the same polarities repeatedly.

**Purpose**: Provide diversification to complement phase saving, preventing catastrophic regressions while maintaining the benefits of phase saving.

**Prevalence**: Used in modern solvers (CaDiCaL, Kissat) with typical frequencies of 2-10%.

---

## Background: The Problem

### Phase Saving Can Get Stuck

Phase saving (Week 4 feature) remembers the last assigned polarity for each variable and reuses it after restarts. This is extremely effective on most instances (50-134× speedup) but can occasionally cause catastrophic regressions:

**Example: easy_3sat_v016_c0067**
- Without phase saving: SAT in 0.003s (119 conflicts)
- With phase saving (no random): TIMEOUT at 10,000 conflicts (3.075s)
- **Problem**: **1,025× slowdown!**

**Root Cause**: Phase saving made fundamentally wrong polarity choices for this instance, and adaptive restarts kept trying the same bad polarities over and over.

**What Didn't Work**:
- Restart postponing (Week 5): Couldn't help because trail never grew (no progress to protect)
- Adaptive restarts alone: Restarted 9,951 times but kept trying same polarities

### The Solution: Random Phase Selection

Occasionally pick a **random polarity** instead of the saved phase:

```
With probability p (e.g., 5%):
    Choose random polarity (True or False with equal probability)
Otherwise:
    Use phase saving (or initial_phase if not saved)
```

**Effect**: Provides diversification to escape local minima while maintaining most phase saving benefits.

## Algorithm

### Core Idea

When picking a branching variable, determine polarity using a 3-level priority:

1. **Random selection** (with probability `random_phase_freq`): Random diversification
2. **Phase saving** (if enabled and phase saved): Remember last polarity
3. **Initial phase** (fallback): Default polarity (usually True)

### Implementation

**Data Structures**:
```python
self.random_phase_freq: float = 0.0  # Probability of random selection (0.0 = disabled)
```

**Polarity Selection Logic**:
```python
def _pick_branching_variable(self) -> Optional[Tuple[str, bool]]:
    # Pick variable with highest VSIDS score
    var = max(unassigned, key=lambda v: self.vsids_scores[v])

    # Determine polarity
    if self.random_phase_freq > 0 and random.random() < self.random_phase_freq:
        # Random phase selection for diversification
        polarity = random.choice([True, False])
    elif self.phase_saving and var in self.saved_phase:
        # Use saved phase
        polarity = self.saved_phase[var]
    else:
        # Fallback to initial phase
        polarity = self.initial_phase

    return (var, polarity)
```

### Parameters

- **`random_phase_freq`**: Probability of random selection (0.0-1.0)
  - `0.0` = Disabled (default, pure phase saving)
  - `0.02-0.05` = Conservative diversification (2-5% random)
  - `0.05-0.10` = Moderate diversification (5-10% random)
  - `0.10+` = Aggressive diversification (10%+ random)

- **`random_seed`**: Random seed for reproducibility (optional)
  - `None` = Non-deterministic (different results each run)
  - Integer = Deterministic (same results each run)

## Analysis

### When Random Phase Selection Excels

**Characteristics**:
- Medium-sized structured instances (12-28 variables)
- Instances where phase saving got stuck in local minima
- Problems with misleading early decisions

**Best Speedups**:
1. easy_3sat_v016_c0067: **3,823× faster** (fixed catastrophic regression)
2. random3sat_v15_c64: **31× faster** (unexpected bonus)
3. easy_3sat_v022_c0092: **3.3× faster**

**Why It Works**:
- Random diversification breaks out of bad polarity loops
- Still uses phase saving 95% of the time (maintains benefits)
- Prevents excessive restarts with same bad polarities

### When Random Phase Selection Struggles

**Characteristics**:
- Very small instances (5-10 variables)
- Problems with simple, obvious solution paths
- Instances that solve in 0 conflicts without randomness

**Worst Regressions**:
1. random3sat_v5_c21: **251× slower** (catastrophic, caused timeout)
2. sat_v10: **8× slower** (disrupted simple solution)
3. easy_3sat_v018_c0075: **15× slower**

**Why It Fails**:
- Randomness adds noise when search space is tiny
- Disrupts simple solution paths that would be found immediately
- 5% random is too aggressive for trivial instances

### Recommended Usage

**DEFAULT: Disabled (`random_phase_freq=0.0`)**
- Most instances work fine with pure phase saving
- Avoids regressions on small instances
- User can enable when needed

**WHEN TO ENABLE**:
1. Timeout with phase saving alone → Try `random_phase_freq=0.05`
2. Large structured instances (100+ variables) → Try `random_phase_freq=0.02-0.05`
3. Known hard instances → Try `random_phase_freq=0.05-0.10`

**WHEN TO DISABLE**:
1. Very small instances (< 15 variables) → Keep disabled
2. Fast solves (< 100 conflicts) → Keep disabled
3. Random/unstructured UNSAT instances → Keep disabled

## Implementation in cdcl_optimized.py

### Parameters

```python
CDCLSolver(cnf,
           random_phase_freq: float = 0.0,     # Probability of random selection
           random_seed: Optional[int] = None)  # Seed for reproducibility
```

### Modified Methods

**`__init__()`**: Initialize random phase selection
```python
# Random phase selection
self.random_phase_freq = random_phase_freq
if random_seed is not None:
    random.seed(random_seed)
```

**`_pick_branching_variable()`**: Use random selection with probability `random_phase_freq`
```python
# Determine polarity using random selection OR phase saving
if self.random_phase_freq > 0 and random.random() < self.random_phase_freq:
    # Random phase selection for diversification (escape local minima)
    polarity = random.choice([True, False])
elif self.phase_saving and var in self.saved_phase:
    polarity = self.saved_phase[var]
else:
    polarity = self.initial_phase
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Disabled (Default)

```python
from bsat import CNFExpression
from cdcl_optimized import CDCLSolver

cnf = CNFExpression.parse("(a | b) & (~a | c) & (~b | ~c)")

# Random phase selection disabled by default
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, use_watched_literals=True)
result = solver.solve()
```

### Example 2: Enable for Hard Instance

```python
# Instance that times out with pure phase saving
cnf = read_dimacs_file('hard_instance.cnf')

# Try with 5% random phase selection
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf,
                    use_watched_literals=True,
                    phase_saving=True,
                    random_phase_freq=0.05,
                    random_seed=42)  # Reproducible results
result = solver.solve(max_conflicts=100000)

print(f"Result: {result}")
print(f"Conflicts: {solver.stats.conflicts}")
```

### Example 3: Adaptive Strategy

```python
# First try with phase saving only
solver1 = CDCLSolver(cnf, phase_saving=True, random_phase_freq=0.0)
result1 = solver1.solve(max_conflicts=10000)

if result1 is None:  # Timeout
    # Retry with 5% random diversification
    solver2 = CDCLSolver(cnf, phase_saving=True, random_phase_freq=0.05)
    result2 = solver2.solve(max_conflicts=10000)
    print(f"Fixed with random phase selection: {result2 is not None}")
```

### Example 4: Tuning Random Frequency

```python
# Test different random frequencies
frequencies = [0.0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20]

for freq in frequencies:
    solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, random_phase_freq=freq, random_seed=42)
    result = solver.solve(max_conflicts=10000)
    print(f"Freq {freq:.2f}: {solver.stats.conflicts} conflicts")
```

## Tuning Guidelines

### Choosing Random Frequency

**Conservative (2-5% recommended)**:
- `random_phase_freq=0.02`: Very light diversification
- `random_phase_freq=0.05`: Balanced (recommended default when enabled)
- Good for: Structured instances, when phase saving mostly works

**Moderate (5-10%)**:
- `random_phase_freq=0.05-0.10`: More aggressive diversification
- Good for: Hard instances, when stuck in local minima

**Aggressive (10%+)**:
- `random_phase_freq=0.10-0.20`: Heavy diversification
- Risk: Too much noise, can disrupt good search paths
- Good for: Experimental tuning only

### Interaction with Other Features

**Phase Saving**:
- Random phase selection complements phase saving
- Recommended: `phase_saving=True` + `random_phase_freq=0.0-0.05`
- Don't disable phase saving when using random phase

**Restart Postponing**:
- Works well together with random phase selection
- Postponing protects progress, random provides diversification
- Recommended: `restart_postponing=True` + `random_phase_freq=0.05`

**Restart Strategy**:
- Glucose restarts + random phase: Good combination
- Luby restarts + random phase: Also works well
- Random helps escape when restarts aren't aggressive enough

## Theory and Intuition

### Why Does Random Phase Selection Work?

**1. Escape Local Minima**
- Phase saving can lock into bad polarity region
- Random selection provides occasional "jumps" to new regions
- Like simulated annealing in optimization

**2. Complementary to Phase Saving**
- Phase saving: Exploit good regions (95% of the time)
- Random selection: Explore new regions (5% of the time)
- Balances exploration vs exploitation

**3. Break Cyclic Behavior**
- Without random: Same polarities → same conflicts → restart → repeat
- With random: Occasional random polarity breaks the cycle
- Example: easy_3sat_v016_c0067 (9,951 restarts stuck in loop)

### Why Can It Fail?

**1. Too Much Noise on Small Instances**
- Small search space (5-10 variables): Only ~32-1024 assignments
- Random selection disrupts simple solution paths
- Overhead not worth it when problem is trivial

**2. Luck-Based**
- Random selection might choose wrong polarity
- Can increase conflicts if unlucky
- Needs balance: 5% is usually safe, 10%+ can be too much

**3. Interaction with Restarts**
- Too many restarts + randomness = instability
- Can create new local minima instead of escaping old ones

## Comparison with Other Techniques

### Random Phase Selection vs Restart Postponing

| Feature | Random Phase | Restart Postponing |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Purpose | Diversification | Protect progress |
| When useful | Stuck in local minima | Making progress toward solution |
| Fixed easy_3sat_v016_c0067? | ✅ Yes (3,823× faster) | ❌ No (trail never grew) |
| Overhead | Minimal (random check) | Minimal (trail size tracking) |
| Recommended | Disable by default | Enable by default |

**Conclusion**: Complementary techniques, both valuable

### Random Phase Selection vs Phase Saving Variants

**Alternatives to random phase selection**:
1. **Progressive phase clearing**: Clear saved phases every N restarts
2. **Weighted phase saving**: Weight by recency or VSIDS
3. **Polarity flipping**: Flip polarity after many conflicts on same variable

**Random phase selection advantages**:
- Simple to implement
- Low overhead
- Proven effective in modern solvers (CaDiCaL, Kissat)
- Tunable (adjust frequency)

## Recommendations

### Default Configuration (Current)

**Disabled by default**:
```python
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf,
                    use_watched_literals=True,
                    phase_saving=True,              # Enabled
                    restart_postponing=True,        # Enabled
                    random_phase_freq=0.0)          # DISABLED
```

**Why**: Avoids regressions on small instances, user can enable when needed

### When to Enable

**Scenario 1**: Timeout with phase saving
```python
# First attempt times out
solver1 = CDCLSolver(cnf, phase_saving=True)
result1 = solver1.solve(max_conflicts=10000)

if result1 is None:
    # Retry with random phase
    solver2 = CDCLSolver(cnf, phase_saving=True, random_phase_freq=0.05)
    result2 = solver2.solve(max_conflicts=10000)
```

**Scenario 2**: Large structured instances
```python
# Known hard instance
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf,
                    phase_saving=True,
                    random_phase_freq=0.05,
                    random_seed=42)
```

**Scenario 3**: Benchmarking/competition
```python
# Try both and pick better
solver_a = CDCLSolver(cnf, random_phase_freq=0.0)
solver_b = CDCLSolver(cnf, random_phase_freq=0.05)
# Run both, use whichever finishes first
```

---

## Future Work

### High Priority: Adaptive Random Frequency

**Idea**: Start with `random_phase_freq=0.0`, increase if stuck
```python
if conflicts > 5000 and restarts > 1000:
    random_phase_freq = 0.05  # Enable diversification
```

**Expected Impact**: Get best of both worlds (no overhead on easy instances, help on hard ones)

### Medium Priority: Variable-Specific Random Selection

**Idea**: Track which variables cause conflicts, apply random selection more to those
```python
if var in problematic_variables:
    random_phase_freq_for_var = 0.10
else:
    random_phase_freq_for_var = 0.02
```

**Expected Impact**: More targeted diversification

### Low Priority: Periodic Random Restarts

**Idea**: Every Nth restart, use 100% random phase selection (full randomization)
```python
if restart_count % 100 == 0:
    use_random_for_all_decisions = True
```

**Expected Impact**: Aggressive diversification without constant overhead
