# Phase Saving in SAT Solvers

**Status**: Implemented ✅
**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Feature**: Week 4 optimization

---

## Overview

**Phase saving** is a crucial heuristic in modern CDCL SAT solvers that remembers the last assigned polarity (true/false) for each variable. When the solver restarts and needs to make a decision on a variable, it preferentially assigns the same polarity it had before.

**Purpose**: Help the solver stay in productive regions of the search space after restarts, avoiding rediscovering the same assignments.

**Universality**: Used in all modern solvers (MiniSAT, Glucose, Kissat, CaDiCaL, MapleSAT)

---

## Background: The Problem

### Without Phase Saving

After a restart, the solver returns to decision level 0 but keeps learned clauses. When making new decisions, it has no memory of which polarities were productive:

```
Initial search:
  x1=True, x2=False, x3=True → Progress, then conflict

After restart (without phase saving):
  x1=True, x2=True, x3=False → Start over from scratch
  x1 might be assigned differently even though True was productive
```

**Result**: Solver repeatedly explores similar unproductive regions

### With Phase Saving

The solver remembers the last polarity for each variable:

```
Initial search:
  x1=True, x2=False, x3=True → Progress, then conflict
  saved_phase = {x1: True, x2: False, x3: True}

After restart (with phase saving):
  x1=True (saved), x2=False (saved), x3=True (saved) → Resume from similar region
  Learned clauses guide away from conflicts
  More likely to find solution quickly
```

**Result**: Solver stays near productive regions, benefits from learned clauses

---

## Algorithm

### Core Idea

Maintain a dictionary `saved_phase: Dict[str, bool]` mapping variables to their last assigned polarity.

### When to Update

Update `saved_phase` **every time** a variable is assigned, whether by:
- **Decision**: Chosen as branching variable
- **Propagation**: Forced by unit clause

### When to Use

When picking a branching variable:
1. Select variable with highest VSIDS score
2. If variable has saved phase, use that polarity
3. Otherwise, use `initial_phase` (default: True)

### Pseudocode

```python
# On assignment
def assign(variable, value):
    trail.append(Assignment(variable, value, ...))
    assignment[variable] = value
    saved_phase[variable] = value  # Remember this polarity

# On branching
def pick_branching_variable():
    var = max(unassigned_vars, key=lambda v: vsids_scores[v])

    if phase_saving and var in saved_phase:
        polarity = saved_phase[var]
    else:
        polarity = initial_phase  # Default: True

    return (var, polarity)
```

---

## Implementation in cdcl_optimized.py

### Parameters

```python
CDCLSolver(cnf,
           phase_saving: bool = True,    # Enable/disable phase saving
           initial_phase: bool = True)   # Default polarity for new variables
```

### Data Structure

```python
self.phase_saving = phase_saving
self.initial_phase = initial_phase
self.saved_phase: Dict[str, bool] = {}  # Variable → last polarity
```

### Modified Methods

**`_assign()`**: Save phase on every assignment
```python
def _assign(self, variable: str, value: bool, antecedent: Optional[Clause] = None):
    # ... add to trail ...
    self.assignment[variable] = value

    # Phase saving: remember this polarity
    if self.phase_saving:
        self.saved_phase[variable] = value
```

**`_pick_branching_variable()`**: Return (variable, polarity) tuple
```python
def _pick_branching_variable(self) -> Optional[Tuple[str, bool]]:
    unassigned = [var for var in self.variables if var not in self.assignment]
    if not unassigned:
        return None

    # Pick variable with highest VSIDS score
    var = max(unassigned, key=lambda v: self.vsids_scores[v])

    # Determine polarity using phase saving
    if self.phase_saving and var in self.saved_phase:
        polarity = self.saved_phase[var]
    else:
        polarity = self.initial_phase

    return (var, polarity)
```

**`solve()`**: Use returned polarity
```python
branch_result = self._pick_branching_variable()
if branch_result is None:
    return dict(self.assignment)  # SAT

var, polarity = branch_result
self.decision_level += 1
self._assign(var, polarity)  # Use saved polarity
```

### Analysis

**Why Phase Saving Helps**:
- Prevents rediscovering same assignments after restarts
- Keeps solver in productive regions of search space
- Especially effective when many restarts occur
- Best on structured problems with clear patterns

**Why Phase Saving Can Hurt**:
- Can get "stuck" trying same polarities repeatedly
- Glucose adaptive restarts may not be aggressive enough to escape
- Needs "restart postponing" (Glucose 2.1+) to avoid over-restarting when stuck
- Occasionally worse on small random instances

**Key Insight**: Phase saving + adaptive restarts need careful tuning
- Huge wins when working well (50-100× faster)
- Catastrophic regressions when stuck (1000× slower)
- Overall: Still valuable, needs complementary features

## Tuning Phase Saving

### Enable/Disable Phase Saving

```python
# Default: enabled (recommended)
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, phase_saving=True)

# Disable for comparison
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, phase_saving=False)
```

### Initial Phase Selection

The `initial_phase` parameter determines the default polarity for variables without saved phase:

```python
# Prefer True (default)
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, phase_saving=True, initial_phase=True)

# Prefer False
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, phase_saving=True, initial_phase=False)
```

**When to use False**: Some problem domains have more False assignments in solutions (e.g., planning problems where most actions are not taken)

### Combining with Restart Strategy

Phase saving interacts with restart strategy:

```python
# Glucose + Phase Saving (default, best for structured)
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, restart_strategy='glucose', phase_saving=True)

# Luby + Phase Saving (more predictable)
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, restart_strategy='luby', phase_saving=True)

# Glucose + No Phase Saving (occasionally better)
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, restart_strategy='glucose', phase_saving=False)
```

**Observation**: Phase saving can amplify both good and bad restart decisions

## When Phase Saving Excels

### Structured Industrial Instances
- Hardware verification
- Software verification
- Planning problems
- Clear patterns in solution space

**Why**: Phase saving helps solver converge to solution region after learning clauses

**Example**: easy_3sat_v014_c0058: 134× speedup (10,000 conflicts → 101 conflicts)

### Satisfiable Instances with Many Restarts
- When solver needs multiple restarts to find solution
- Phase saving maintains progress across restarts
- Learned clauses + saved polarities = fast convergence

**Example**: easy_3sat_v024_c0100: 51× speedup (971 conflicts → 52 conflicts)

---

## When Phase Saving Can Struggle

### Getting Stuck in Bad Regions
- Saved polarities keep solver in unproductive region
- Adaptive restarts not aggressive enough to escape
- Needs restart postponing or different restart strategy

**Example**: easy_3sat_v016_c0067: 1025× slowdown (timeout with 10K conflicts)

### Small Random Instances
- Very small search space (5-10 variables)
- Overhead of tracking phases not worth it
- Simple strategy works fine

**Example**: random3sat_v7_c30: 2.5× slowdown

### UNSAT Instances with Wrong Polarities
- If saved polarities lead away from proof of UNSAT
- Can explore wrong parts of search space repeatedly

---

## Related Features (Future Work)

### Restart Postponing (Glucose 2.1+)
**Problem**: Phase saving + frequent restarts can get stuck

**Solution**: Don't restart if trail is growing rapidly
- Check if recent trail sizes are increasing
- If yes, postpone restart (making progress!)
- If no, restart as usual (stuck)

**Implementation**:
```python
def should_restart_with_postponing():
    if not should_restart():
        return False

    # Check if trail growing (sign of progress)
    recent_trail_sizes = [len(trail) at recent restarts]
    if trail_growing(recent_trail_sizes):
        return False  # Postpone restart

    return True  # Restart as usual
```

**Expected Impact**: Fix regressions like easy_3sat_v016_c0067

### Rapid Restarts (Glucose 4+)
**Idea**: Very aggressive restarts in early search (first 1000 conflicts)
- Find easy solutions quickly
- Switch to normal restarts after initial phase

**Expected Impact**: Better on satisfiable instances

### Phase Saving Variants

**Random Phase Selection**: Occasionally pick random polarity instead of saved (diversification)

**Weighted Phase Saving**: Weight saved phase by how recently it was assigned

**Per-Restart Phase Saving**: Clear saved phases every N restarts

---

## Theory and Intuition

### Why Does Phase Saving Work?

**1. Locality in Search Space**
- SAT problems often have structure
- Solutions cluster in certain regions
- If search was productive before restart, likely still productive nearby

**2. Learned Clauses Encode Global Knowledge**
- After restart, learned clauses prevent repeating mistakes
- Phase saving + learned clauses = guided search in productive region

**3. VSIDS + Phase Saving Synergy**
- VSIDS picks variables involved in recent conflicts (important variables)
- Phase saving tries polarities that were productive recently
- Together: focus on important variables with good polarities

### Why Can It Fail?

**1. Local Minima**
- Saved polarities might lead to a local minimum
- Adaptive restarts might not escape
- Need either:
  - Restart postponing (stay longer when growing)
  - Diversification (occasional random phase)
  - Different restart strategy

**2. Misleading Early Decisions**
- Early search might explore wrong region entirely
- Saved phases remember those wrong decisions
- Takes many restarts to correct

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Default Phase Saving
```python
from bsat import CNFExpression
from cdcl_optimized import CDCLSolver

cnf = CNFExpression.parse("(a | b) & (~a | c) & (~b | ~c)")

# Phase saving enabled by default
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, use_watched_literals=True)
result = solver.solve()

print(f"Result: {result}")
print(f"Conflicts: {solver.stats.conflicts}")
print(f"Saved phases: {solver.saved_phase}")
```

### Example 2: Disable Phase Saving for Comparison
```python
# Without phase saving
solver_no_ps = CDCLSolver(cnf, use_watched_literals=True, phase_saving=False)
result_no_ps = solver_no_ps.solve()

print(f"With PS: {solver.stats.conflicts} conflicts")
print(f"Without PS: {solver_no_ps.stats.conflicts} conflicts")
```

### Example 3: Custom Initial Phase
```python
# Prefer False for planning problems
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, phase_saving=True, initial_phase=False)
result = solver.solve()
```

---

## Debugging Phase Saving

### Check if Phase Saving is Active

```python
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, phase_saving=True)
result = solver.solve()

print(f"Phase saving enabled: {solver.phase_saving}")
print(f"Saved phases: {solver.saved_phase}")
print(f"Number of variables with saved phase: {len(solver.saved_phase)}")
```

### Trace Phase Saving Decisions

Add debug prints to `_pick_branching_variable()`:
```python
var = max(unassigned, key=lambda v: self.vsids_scores[v])

if self.phase_saving and var in self.saved_phase:
    polarity = self.saved_phase[var]
    print(f"DEBUG: Using saved phase {var}={polarity}")
else:
    polarity = self.initial_phase
    print(f"DEBUG: Using initial phase {var}={polarity}")
```

### Identify Bad Phase Saving Cases

If solver is slow, check:
```python
if solver.stats.conflicts > 5000 and solver.stats.restarts > 1000:
    print("⚠️  Many conflicts + restarts: might be stuck")
    print(f"   Restarts/Conflicts ratio: {solver.stats.restarts / solver.stats.conflicts:.2f}")
    if solver.stats.restarts / solver.stats.conflicts > 0.2:
        print("   Consider: disable phase_saving or tune restart strategy")
```

## Recommendations

### Default Configuration (Recommended)

```python
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf,
                    use_watched_literals=True,
                    phase_saving=True,           # Enable phase saving
                    initial_phase=True,          # Prefer True
                    restart_strategy='glucose')  # Adaptive restarts
```

**Why**: Standard configuration used in modern solvers, best overall performance

### If Phase Saving Causes Slowdown

**Option 1**: Disable phase saving
```python
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, phase_saving=False)
```

**Option 2**: Try Luby restarts (more predictable)
```python
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, restart_strategy='luby', phase_saving=True)
```

**Option 3**: Tune Glucose parameters (more aggressive restarts)
```python
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, restart_strategy='glucose', glucose_k=0.7, phase_saving=True)
```

### For Random UNSAT Instances

```python
# Consider disabling phase saving on pure random
solver = CDCLSolver(cnf, phase_saving=False, restart_strategy='luby')
```
