#### 13. MARKET-SAT (Economic Auction Theory) 🌟🌟 GROUNDBREAKING

**Status**: ✅ Working (100% correctness validated)

**Location**: `market_sat/`

**Novelty**: **Groundbreaking** - First application of auction theory and mechanism design to SAT

**Description**: Treats SAT as a market equilibrium problem where clauses bid for variable assignments. Uses Walrasian tatonnement (price adjustment) to find Nash equilibrium, which corresponds to satisfying assignments.

**Key Features**:
- **Clause bidders**: Each clause acts as economic agent with budget
- **Variable auctions**: Variables auctioned to highest bidder
- **Price discovery**: Tatonnement process adjusts prices based on excess demand
- **Equilibrium detection**: Market clearing = all clauses satisfied
- **Budget allocation**: Unit clauses get infinite budget (highest priority)
- **Consumer surplus**: Clauses maximize value - price

**Theoretical Foundation**:
- Walrasian general equilibrium (Arrow & Debreu 1954)
- Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanisms
- Nash equilibrium as solution concept
- Tatonnement price adjustment process

**Performance**: 9/9 correct on simple_tests (100% agreement with CDCL)

**See**: `market_sat/README.md` for comprehensive economic theory and examples

**Status**: ✅ Working (100% correctness validated)

**Description**: Treats SAT as thermodynamic energy minimization problem, analogous to protein folding. Uses simulated annealing (Metropolis-Hastings) and parallel tempering to find ground state (all clauses satisfied).

**Key Features**:
- **Energy landscape**: Unsatisfied clauses = positive energy (unfavorable)
- **Hamiltonian**: E = Σ E_clause + Σ E_pair (total system energy)
- **Simulated annealing**: Temperature-controlled exploration → exploitation
- **Metropolis criterion**: P(accept) = min(1, exp(-ΔE/T))
- **Parallel tempering**: 8 replicas at different temperatures with swapping
- **Move operators**: Single flip, cluster flip, swap, biased, mutation
- **Adaptive cooling**: Geometric, linear, logarithmic, and adaptive schedules

**Theoretical Foundation**:
- Anfinsen's thermodynamic hypothesis (Nobel Prize 1972)
- Kirkpatrick et al. (1983) simulated annealing
- Statistical mechanics and Boltzmann distribution

#### 16. P-BIT (Probabilistic-Bit Gibbs Sampling) ⚛️ PHYSICS-INSPIRED

**Status**: ✅ Working (core production solver)

**Location**: `src/bsat/pbit.py` *(core solver, registered here for benchmark comparison)*

**Novelty**: Faithful software model of probabilistic-bit (p-bit) hardware — the building block of Ising machines and p-computers built from stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions.

**Description**: Each variable is a p-bit that flips with probability σ(−β·ΔE), where the energy E is the number of unsatisfied clauses — the exact heat-bath Gibbs update of p-bit devices. Annealing the inverse temperature β from hot (random sampling) to cold (greedy descent) performs simulated annealing whose ground states are exactly the satisfying assignments.

**Key Features**:
- **Heat-bath p-bit update**: P(flip) = σ(−β·ΔE), the p-bit device equation m = sgn(rand(−1,1) + tanh(I))
- **Clause-count energy**: E = #unsatisfied clauses — exact for any k-SAT, no auxiliary variables
- **β-annealing**: geometric or linear schedules from β_min to β_max, plus random restarts
- **Incremental ΔE**: occurrence lists give O(deg(v)) per p-bit update
- **Reproducible**: private RNG + sorted variable order

**Theoretical Foundation**:
- Camsari, Faria, Sutton, Datta (2017): "Stochastic p-bits for invertible logic", PRX 7, 031014
- Aadit et al. (2022): "Massively parallel probabilistic computing with sparse Ising machines", Nature Electronics 5
- Kirkpatrick et al. (1983) simulated annealing; Gibbs sampling of the Boltzmann distribution

**Performance**: Incomplete solver (like WalkSAT/Schöning); the benchmark registration wraps it with a CDCL fallback so None never masquerades as UNSAT. The core solver itself has no fallback.

**See**: `docs/pbit-solver.md` for full theory (including the Ising/QUBO hardware embedding)
