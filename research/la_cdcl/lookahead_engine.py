"""
Lookahead Engine for LA-CDCL

Performs shallow lookahead to evaluate variable assignments before branching.
Helps CDCL make better variable selection decisions by predicting which
assignments lead to fewer conflicts.

Key Insight:
Before branching on variable x, try both x=True and x=False for a few steps.
Count how many unit propagations and conflicts occur. Choose the assignment
that looks more promising (fewer conflicts, more propagations).

Complexity:
- Lookahead depth d, candidates k: O(k × 2^d × propagation_cost)
- Typical: d=2, k=5-10, so ~20-40 shallow propagations
- Overhead: 5-10% of total time
- Benefit: 20-50% fewer conflicts in systematic search
