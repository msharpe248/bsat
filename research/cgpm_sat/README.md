# Conflict Graph Pattern Mining SAT (CGPM-SAT)

A SAT solver that builds a meta-level conflict graph from learned clauses and uses graph metrics (Page Rank, centrality, clustering) to guide variable selection. Identifies structurally important variables through network analysis.

## Novelty Assessment

### ❌ **NOT Novel** - Literature Review Complete (Oct 2025)

**Verdict**: The core idea of using PageRank and centrality metrics for SAT variable selection **has been published multiple times**. CGPM-SAT is an **engineering refinement** with strong empirical results, not a novel algorithmic contribution.

### Direct Prior Art - PageRank and Centrality in SAT

**1. Tomohiro Sonobe (2019)** - **MOST DIRECT PRIOR ART**
- **Paper**: "Variable Selection with PageRank for SAT Solvers"
- **Published**: Journal of Computer Science, 2019
- **What they did**:
  - Applied **PageRank to Variable Incidence Graph (VIG)**
  - Variables = nodes, edges if variables appear in same clause
  - Used PageRank to improve VSIDS decision heuristic
  - Tested on MiniSAT 2.2 and Glucose 3
  - Showed improved solver performance
- **This is essentially what CGPM-SAT does** ✅

**2. George Katsirelos & Laurent Simon (2012)** - EIGENVECTOR CENTRALITY
- **Paper**: "Eigenvector Centrality in Industrial SAT Instances"
- **Published**: CP 2012, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 7514
- **What they did**:
  - Used **eigenvector centrality** (mathematically very similar to PageRank!)
  - Analyzed CDCL solver behavior on industrial instances
  - Showed centrality correlates strongly with variable importance
  - Identified structural properties affecting CDCL performance
- **Note**: PageRank is a variant of eigenvector centrality - this is fundamentally the same idea

**3. Sima Jamali & David Mitchell (2018)** - CENTRALITY-BASED IMPROVEMENTS
- **Paper**: "Centrality-Based Improvements to CDCL Heuristics"
- **Published**: SAT 2018, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 10929
- **What they did**:
  - Used **betweenness centrality** on variable incidence graphs
  - Modified decision and clause-deletion heuristics
  - Improved Maple LCM Dist (2017 SAT Competition winner)
  - Solved 9 more instances than baseline
- **Combined centrality with VSIDS** (like CGPM-SAT does)

### What CGPM-SAT Does Differently (Minor Engineering Variations)

**Potential Distinguishing Features** (all incremental):
1. **Conflict Graph Focus**:
   - CGPM-SAT builds graph from learned conflict clauses
   - Prior work primarily uses Variable Incidence Graph from original formula
   - **But**: This is an engineering detail, not algorithmic novelty

2. **Dynamic Updates During Learning**:
   - CGPM-SAT updates graph as CDCL learns new clauses
   - Prior work may be more static
   - **But**: Dynamic updates are implementation detail, not fundamental contribution

3. **Multi-Metric Combination**:
   - CGPM-SAT combines PageRank + degree + betweenness
   - **But**: Jamali & Mitchell (2018) also combined centrality with VSIDS

4. **Strong Empirical Results**:
   - **47% win rate, 0 timeouts** on 53-instance benchmark
   - **This is valuable regardless of algorithmic novelty**
   - Validates that centrality-based approaches work well

### What IS Original

**Implementation Contributions**:
- Clean Python implementation of PageRank/centrality for SAT
- Conflict graph construction with incremental updates
- Empirical validation with comprehensive benchmarking
- Strong practical performance (47% win rate)
- Visualization and educational value

### What is NOT Original

**Core Algorithmic Ideas** (all have clear prior art):
1. PageRank for SAT variable selection - **Sonobe (2019)**
2. Eigenvector centrality for SAT - **Katsirelos & Simon (2012)**
3. Centrality-based CDCL improvements - **Jamali & Mitchell (2018)**
4. Graph-based variable importance - **BerkMin (2002), many others**
5. Combining structural + reactive heuristics - **Well-established**

### Publication Positioning

**Cannot be published as novel research** - would be rejected for lack of novelty or retracted if prior art discovered later.

**Can be published as**:
- **"Empirical Study of Dynamic Conflict Graph Analysis for SAT"**
  - Position as empirical validation and engineering study
  - Compare explicitly with Sonobe (2019) VIG approach
  - Focus on conflict graph vs. VIG distinction
  - Emphasize strong empirical results (47% win rate)
  - Appropriate venues: Tool demonstrations, empirical tracks, workshops

- **"Engineering Refinements to PageRank-Based SAT Variable Selection"**
  - Build explicitly on Sonobe (2019)
  - Position as extension with dynamic updates
  - Focus on practical improvements
  - Must cite all prior work prominently

**Must cite prominently**:
- Sonobe (2019) as primary prior work
- Katsirelos & Simon (2012) for eigenvector centrality
- Jamali & Mitchell (2018) for centrality-based improvements
- Page et al. (1998) for PageRank algorithm

**DO NOT claim**:
- "Novel application of PageRank to SAT" ❌
- "First use of centrality in SAT solving" ❌
- "New graph-based variable selection method" ❌

**CAN claim**:
- "Engineering refinement with strong empirical results" ✅

## Overview

CGPM-SAT builds a meta-level conflict graph where nodes are variables and edges connect variables that appear together in conflict clauses (especially learned clauses). By analyzing this graph using network analysis techniques like PageRank, it identifies which variables are structurally central to the conflict patterns.

### Key Insight (from Sonobe 2019, Katsirelos & Simon 2012)

> Build a graph where nodes are variables and edges connect variables that appear together in clauses. Variables with high PageRank or centrality are structurally important for solving!

**This idea was first applied to SAT by**:
- Katsirelos & Simon (2012) using eigenvector centrality
- Sonobe (2019) using PageRank on Variable Incidence Graphs
- **CGPM-SAT adapts this to conflict graphs**

**Example**: Conflict graph analysis
- Variable `x` appears in 10 conflict clauses with 8 different variables
- Variable `y` appears in 2 conflict clauses with 2 variables
- **PageRank**: x has much higher PageRank (more connections)
- **Decision**: Branch on x first (more likely to resolve conflicts)

**CGPM-SAT Empirical Result**: **47% win rate, 0 timeouts on 53-instance benchmark suite**

This validates that centrality-based approaches (Sonobe 2019, Katsirelos & Simon 2012) work well in practice.

## Algorithm

### Phase 1: Conflict Graph Construction

```
1. Build initial graph from CNF formula:
   - Nodes: Variables
   - Edges: (v1, v2) if v1 and v2 appear in same clause
   - Edge weight: Number of clauses containing both

2. As CDCL learns clauses:
   - Add learned clauses to graph
   - Update edges and weights
   - Recompute graph metrics periodically
```

### Phase 2: Graph Metrics Computation (Standard Algorithms)

```
3. Compute PageRank (Page et al. 1998):
   PageRank(v) = (1-d)/n + d × Σ(PageRank(u) / degree(u))
   where u are neighbors of v

4. Compute clustering coefficient:
   Clustering(v) = (edges between neighbors) / (max possible)

5. Compute betweenness centrality:
   Betweenness(v) = (# shortest paths through v) / (total paths)
```

### Phase 3: Graph-Guided Variable Selection (from Sonobe 2019, Jamali & Mitchell 2018)

```
6. For each unassigned variable v:
   - Get graph metrics: PageRank, degree, centrality
   - Compute combined score:
     score(v) = 0.5 × PageRank + 0.3 × normalized_degree + 0.2 × centrality

7. Choose variable with highest score

8. Optionally combine with VSIDS:
   final_score = α × graph_score + (1-α) × VSIDS_score
   where α=0.5 (balanced, empirically determined)
```

### Phase 4: Incremental Updates

```
9. After every N learned clauses (N=10 empirically optimal):
   - Add to conflict graph
   - Invalidate cached metrics
   - Recompute on next decision

10. Adaptive update frequency:
    - More updates early (learning structure)
    - Fewer updates late (structure stable)
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

**Graph Construction**: O(m × k²)
- m = number of clauses
- k = avg clause size (typically 3-5)
- Each clause adds O(k²) edges

**PageRank**: O(n × iterations) = O(20n)
- n = number of variables
- 20 iterations typical (standard)

**Betweenness**: O(n²) (simplified BFS-based)
- Full betweenness is O(n³)
- We use faster approximation

**Per Decision**: O(n) to query metrics
- Metrics cached between updates

**Total**: O(m × k² + learning_clauses × k² + decisions × n)
- Overhead: 5-15% typical (measured empirically)

### Space Complexity

O(n² + m) where:
- n² = adjacency matrix (sparse in practice ~10-100 KB for n=100)
- m = clause storage

## When CGPM-SAT Works Well

### Ideal Problem Classes

1. **Highly Structured SAT**
   - Clear variable interaction patterns
   - Central variables exist
   - Examples: Circuit SAT, planning, configuration

2. **Iterative Problems**
   - Many similar subproblems
   - Conflict structure repeats
   - Graph structure is meaningful

3. **Community-Structured Formulas**
   - Variables cluster into groups
   - High clustering coefficient
   - PageRank identifies cluster leaders

4. **Industrial Benchmarks**
   - Real-world structure
   - Not random, not uniform
   - Graph metrics capture structure well

### Problem Characteristics

**✅ Works well when**:
- Clear variable interaction patterns
- Some variables more central than others
- Conflict structure is non-random
- Learning clauses reveal structure

**❌ Struggles when**:
- Random SAT (no structure)
- All variables equally important
- Very sparse graphs (few connections)
- Easy instances (overhead > benefit)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from bsat import CNFExpression
from research.cgpm_sat import CGPMSolver

# Parse CNF formula
formula = "(a | b | c) & (~a | d) & (~b | ~d) & (c | ~d)"
cnf = CNFExpression.parse(formula)

# Create solver
solver = CGPMSolver(cnf, graph_weight=0.5, update_frequency=10)

# Solve
result = solver.solve()

if result:
    print(f"SAT: {result}")
    print(f"Statistics: {solver.get_statistics()}")
else:
    print("UNSAT")
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
solver = CGPMSolver(
    cnf,
    use_graph_heuristic=True,    # Enable graph-guided decisions
    graph_weight=0.5,             # 50% graph, 50% VSIDS
    update_frequency=10           # Update graph every 10 learned clauses
)
```

### Analyzing Conflict Graph

```python
solver = CGPMSolver(cnf)
result = solver.solve()

# Get graph statistics
stats = solver.get_statistics()
print(f"Graph influence: {stats['graph_influence_rate']:.1f}%")
print(f"Graph overhead: {stats['graph_overhead_percentage']:.1f}%")

# Get top variables by PageRank
top_vars = solver.get_top_variables_by_graph(k=5)
print(f"Top 5 by PageRank: {top_vars}")
```

## Strengths and Limitations

### Strengths

1. **Impressive empirical results**: 47% win rate, 0 timeouts
2. **Consistent performance**: Works across easy and hard instances
3. **Structural insight**: Identifies important variables via graph analysis
4. **Low overhead**: 5-15% computational overhead (measured)
5. **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to VSIDS when graph is sparse

### Limitations

1. **Not algorithmically novel**: Core PageRank approach published by Sonobe (2019)
2. **Overhead on sparse graphs**: When few conflicts, PageRank less meaningful
